== Data formats and schema

Serialbench generates structured YAML output for benchmark results, with
different formats for single-environment and multi-environment runs.

The data formats include:

* **Single benchmark results**: Individual benchmark run output
* **Result set data structure**: Multi-platform benchmark aggregation
* **JSON schema specification**: Complete schema validation rules
* **Configuration file formats**: Docker and ASDF configuration examples

== Prerequisites

=== System requirements

* **Ruby**: 3.0 or later (3.3+ recommended for best performance)
* **Operating system**: Linux, macOS, or Windows
* **Architecture**: x86_64 or ARM64

=== Library dependencies

**System dependencies** (required for some native extensions):

[source,bash]
----
# macOS with Homebrew
$ brew install libxml2 libxslt

# Ubuntu/Debian
$ sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev build-essential

# CentOS/RHEL/Fedora
$ sudo yum install libxml2-devel libxslt-devel gcc gcc-c++
----

=== GitHub API token (optional but recommended)

Serialbench fetches Ruby build definitions from the GitHub API. While this works
without authentication, GitHub imposes strict rate limits on unauthenticated
requests (60 requests per hour). For better reliability, especially in CI/CD
environments or when running multiple benchmarks, set the `GITHUB_TOKEN`
environment variable.

**Rate limits:**

* **Without token**: 60 requests per hour
* **With token**: 1,000 requests per hour

**Setting the token:**

[source,bash]
----
# For local usage
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here

# For GitHub Actions (automatic)
# GitHub Actions automatically provides ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
# No manual configuration needed in workflows
----

**Creating a token:**

. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
. Select scope: `public_repo` (for accessing public repositories)
. Copy the generated token
. Store it securely in your environment

NOTE: The token is optional. Serialbench will work without it but may hit rate
limits when updating Ruby build definitions frequently.

== Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'serialbench'
----

And then execute:

[source]
----
$ bundle install
----

Or install it yourself as:

[source]
----

== Configuration Files

=== Environment configuration

Environment configuration files define how benchmarks are executed in different runtime environments.

.Environment configuration for Docker (`config/environments/docker-ruby-3.4.yml`)
[source,yaml]
----
---
name: docker-ruby-3.4
kind: docker
created_at: '2025-06-13T15:18:43+08:00'

warmup: 3
----

== Results structure

=== Individual run results

Results are stored in a structured directory format, with each run containing
raw benchmark data and execution logs.

The directory is located at `results/runs/{name}/`, where `{name}` is the name
of the environment used for the benchmark.

[source]
----
results/runs/docker-ruby-33-results/
├── results.yaml                    # Raw benchmark data
└── benchmark.log                   # Execution log
----

=== ResultSet structure

ResultSets aggregate multiple benchmark runs for comparison. They are stored in
a structured directory format at `results/sets/{name}/`, where `{name}` is the
name of the result set.

[source]
----
results/sets/ruby-version-comparison/
└── resultset.yml                  # Result set configuration
----

== Benchmark categories

=== Parsing performance

Measures the time required to parse serialized data into Ruby objects.

* **Small files**: ~1KB configuration-style documents
* **Medium files**: ~1MB API responses with 1,000 records
* **Large files**: ~10MB data exports with 10,000 records

=== Generation performance

Tests how quickly libraries can convert Ruby objects into serialized strings.

=== Streaming performance

Evaluates streaming event-based parsing performance for libraries that support
it, which processes data sequentially and is memory-efficient for large files.

=== Memory usage analysis

Profiles memory allocation and retention during serialization operations using
the `memory_profiler` gem.

== Interactive Dashboard Features

The generated HTML sites provide comprehensive interactive dashboards with:

=== Navigation and Filtering
* **Format tabs**: Dedicated views for XML, JSON, YAML, and TOML
* **Operation sections**: Parsing, generation, streaming, and memory usage
* **Dynamic filtering**: Platform, Ruby version, and environment selection
* **Real-time updates**: Charts update instantly based on filter selections

=== Visualization Capabilities
* **Chart.js integration**: Interactive performance charts with hover details
* **Multi-scale handling**: Automatic Y-axis scaling for different performance ranges
* **Color-coded data**: Consistent color schemes across serializers and environments
* **Responsive design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile viewing

=== User Experience
* **Theme toggle**: Light and dark mode with persistent preferences
* **Keyboard navigation**: Full accessibility support
* **Fast loading**: Optimized JavaScript for quick dashboard initialization
* **Export capabilities**: JSON data export for further analysis


== Development

=== Running Tests

[source]
----
$ bundle exec rake
$ bundle exec rspec
----

=== Adding a new serializers

To add support for additional serialization libraries:

. Create a new serializer class in `lib/serialbench/serializers/{format}/`
. Inherit from the appropriate base class (`BaseXmlSerializer`, `BaseJsonSerializer`, etc.)
. Implement the required methods: `parse`, `generate`, `name`, `version`
. Add the serializer to the registry in `lib/serialbench/serializers.rb`
. Update documentation and tests

=== Contributing

. Fork the repository
. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`)
. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/my-new-feature`)
. Create a new Pull Request


== Known issues

=== Syck YAML serializer segmentation faults

The Syck YAML serializer at version 1.5+ is known to cause segmentation faults
on Ruby 3.1 and later versions. Serialbench automatically detects this
problematic configuration and:

* Displays a warning message when Syck is detected on Ruby 3.1+
* Skips Syck benchmarks to prevent crashes
* Continues with other YAML serializers (Psych)

=== Syck overrides YAML constant

On occasion after Syck is loaded, the constant `YAML` may be redefined to
`Syck`, which can cause issues in other parts of the codebase. This can cause
YAML output to fail when using libraries that expect `YAML` to have the
`Psych` API.

In `benchmark_cli.rb` there is therefore such code to ensure that
`YAML` is defined as `Psych` when writing to file is needed:

[source,ruby]
----
# Restore YAML to use Psych for output, otherwise lutaml-model's to_yaml
# will have no output
Object.const_set(:YAML, Psych)
----
